# ConwayLanguage
## To Download
This is a visual studio 2022 file. 

## Purpose
This is a school assignment that I chose amongst options, and ultimately it should be a programming language catered to the Conway's Game Of Life.

## Benefits
I have learned about through lectures the process of making a language and each part of what makes language work, but actually making a lexer and a parser from scratch has dramatically increased my understanding and respect for them.

## Status
This project is a school project and is not finished, so expect regular updates.
