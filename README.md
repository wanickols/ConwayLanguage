# ConwayLanguage
## To Download
This is a visual studio 2022 file. 

## Purpose
This is a school assignment that I chose amongst options, and ultimately it should be a programming language catered to the Conway's Game Of Life. <-- Complete

## Benefits
I have learned from lectures the process of making a language and each part of what makes language work, but actually making a lexer, parser, and intepreter from scratch has dramatically increased my understanding and respect for them.

## Status
This project is finished for the assignment. I may continue down the line, but no immediate plans.
